    <p>Behold, it’s the totally baller house of the week: there’s a bar, a theater, an infinity
    pool, iPads. Yes, there are iPads.</p>

    <p>This 1.32-acre, 10,279-square foot beachfront property in Cape Cod has been on the
    market for about three years but couldn’t entice a buyer (maybe because of its $13.9
    million price tag). The Osterville estate, owned by Edward Breslow, a former
    executive at EMC Corporation, will now be sold at an auction next month. The
    current listed price has no bearing on the auction price.</p>

    <p>This house probably looks even more baller in person. Go do it — open houses are
    every Wednesday to Sunday from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
